# Toy Lisp in V
## Work in Progress
This is just a quick little project to get a working toy lisp in V!

This should be a fun experiment, I hope to benchmark how this compares to other implementations of LISP in C, C++, and Rust. Most importantly, V doesnt come with closures or lambdas, so it should be really interesting implementing those.
